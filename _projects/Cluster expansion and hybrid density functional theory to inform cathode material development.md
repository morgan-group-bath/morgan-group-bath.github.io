Kit is a member of the Faraday Institution-funded CATMAT project. His project centres on the computational design of new, high power and high energy density lithium-ion battery cathode materials, composed of earth-abundant and non-toxic elements. The work will employ first-principles calculations using hybrid-exchange density functional theory to examine the structural and electronic properties of transition metal oxides of interest as prospective battery cathode materials. Structures generated will be used to train cluster-expansions to sample configurational space and subsequently perform Monte-Carlo simulations to predict properties of interest. Kitâ€™s work will be conducted in close collaboration with colleagues in the CATMAT project undertaking experimental work, in order to gain deeper insight into the materials properties.
