title: Computational Modelling of Elementary Processes at Surfaces and Interfaces

description: The world is facing two major problems: the global climate change and the scarce of energy. Both these issues are affecting our daily-lives in an adverse manner and the situation is deteriorating day by day. In one hand the energy generation from the traditional fossil fuels are escalating the global climate change, on the other hand the reserve of fossil fuels is limited which will run out in due course of time. Over the past few years, my interest of research activities has covered a wide variety of areas addressing these aspects including various materials for green energy applications, heterogeneous catalysis technologies and corrosion protection.

The world is facing two major problems: the global climate change and the scarce of energy. Both these issues are affecting our daily-lives in an adverse manner and the situation is deteriorating day by day. In one hand the energy generation from the traditional fossil fuels are escalating the global climate change, on the other hand the reserve of fossil fuels is limited which will run out in due course of time. Over the past few years, my interest of research activities has covered a wide variety of areas addressing these aspects including various materials for green energy applications, heterogeneous catalysis technologies and corrosion protection.

My current research project involves computational modelling of NMC cathode materials for understanding their applicability in the long-range electric vehicles as well as for future all-solid state batteries. I study the structure, stability and electronic properties, the surface stabilization mechanisms and the origin of degradation in NMC811. I employ first principles DFT approaches in order to elucidate these properties. The project is part of the Multi-Scale-Modelling (MSM) of Cathodes funded by the Faraday Institution.
