I am interested in using low-cost screening techniques such as machine learning to explore vast areas of chemical space to suggest new inorganic materials for energy applications. I carried out my PhD within the [Walsh Materials Design Group](http://wmd-group.github.io) as a student in the [Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies](http://www.csct.ac.uk) where my project focussed on the use of of empirical rules and data-mining to supplement accurate electronic structure methods for the prediction of new solar energy materials.

Right now, I am a Doctoral Prize Fellow at Imperial College London and am working with Ben Morgan, [Aron Walsh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ktvn91gAAAAJ&hl=en) and various other groups affiliated with the [Faraday Institution](https://faraday.ac.uk) to design new and better battery materials. My current focus is on the computational discovery of an exciting new class of compounds known as anion redox materials.
