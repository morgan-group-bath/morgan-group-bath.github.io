I am interested in using low-cost screening techniques such as machine learning to explore vast areas of chemical space to suggest new inorganic materials for energy applications. I carried out my PhD within the Walsh Materials Design Group as a student in the Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies where my project focussed on the use of of empirical rules and data-mining to supplement accurate electronic structure methods for the prediction of new solar energy materials.

Right now, I am a Doctoral Prize Fellow at Imperial College London and am working with Ben Morgan, Aron Walsh and various other groups affiliated with the Faraday Institution to design new and better battery materials. My current focus is on the computational discovery of an exciting new class of compounds known as anion redox materials.
