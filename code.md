### bsym

[bsym: A Basic Symmetry Module](https://github.com/bjmorgan/bsym) is a basic Python symmetry module. It consists of core classes that describe configuration vector spaces, their symmetry operations, and specific configurations of objects within these spaces. The module also contains an interface for working with [`pymatgen`](http://pymatgen.org) `Structure` objects, to allow simple generation of disordered symmetry-inequivalent structures from a symmetric parent crystal structure.
 
 ### pyscses
  
[pyscses](https://github.com/georgiewellock/PYSCSES) is a Python module that implements a one-dimensional Poisson-Boltzmann solver, used for modelling space charge properties in solid materials. 
In polycrystalline solid materials, grain boundaries and interfaces exist separating different crystalline domains. The structural distortion at these interfaces causes segregation of charge carriers to, or away from the grain boundary core. Due to this, the grain boundary core carries a net charge which causes the depletion or accumulation of charge carriers in the regions adjacent, known as space charge regions. Due to the variation on charge carrier concentrations, the ionic conductivity of the material can be strongly affected by the presence of grain boundaries.
