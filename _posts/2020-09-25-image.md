This week we welcome three new PhD researchers to the Morgan Materials Modelling group. Hollie Richards joins us after completing a Chemistry MSci from the University of Nottingham, and Luke Rose and Benedek Goldmann join the group after both completing a Chemistry with Industry Training MSci here at the University of Bath. 

We look forward to working with you, and hope you enjoy your PhD journeys with us!
